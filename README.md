# Random-Color-Picker


In this project, I built a program that helps designers think of new color schemes.

This program will set the screenâ€™s background to a random color. Clicking a button will refresh to a new, random color. [Random generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies) are a well-known tool for breaking a creative rut.
